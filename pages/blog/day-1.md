I'm not very good about exercising. Now that I am in full fledged adulthood, its high time I develop habbits for healthiness that will last me the rest of my life. This means:

1. Eating healthy
2. Exercizing
3. Other stuff probably

I've already been fortunate enough to be forced into eating healthy largely due to the digestive issues I have encountered (that are now much improved thanks to [the GAPS diet](http://www.gapsdiet.com/)). So one down, two to go!

1. ~~Eating healthy~~
2. Exercizing
3. Other stuff probably

So, Exercizing. After reading and lilstening to the [Art of Manliness](http://artofmanliness.com), I wound up buying [Starting Strength](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-Basic-Barbell-Training/dp/0982522738). The whole idea is to take a **complete** beginner and make them _strong_ with an emphasis on long term health.

I recently came across another article that corroborated what I found on AoM - provocatively entitled [Everything You Know About Fitness Is a Lie](http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504). The tldr; is that the author came accross _SS_ by other means, followed it, and had great results. That is a horrible summary. You should probably read it yourself. 

I had been holding off because it is uncomfortable and new to go to the gym and do things when you don't _really_ know what you are doing. The book helped with that - but I still lacked the experience. Well, yesterday, I dove in and I'm glad I did. It wasn't anything like I was worried about!

So here goes. See you in 6 months, hopefully much stronger then.
