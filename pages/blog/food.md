In order to get strong when you are a novice, you need to keep increasing weight until you can't any longer.  When you can't increase any more, you are no longer a novice, but an _intermediate_ athlete, according to Starting Strength. 

You are supposed to be able to increase weight linearly for the first many months, up to six I think. For the first few weeks, you increase each lift by 10lbs each workout, then by 5lbs. This should go on for some time. 

Rippetoe (the author) says if you aren't meeting these metrics, it is most likely due to an inadequate intake of food. The recommended intake is `1g` of protein per `lb` of weight. 

That means I need to be eating `150g` of protein per day. That takes some extra work. 

Here's a breakdown of some common things I eat and their protein content:

- Eggs (1 egg): 6g
- Beef (1oz): 7g
- Chicken (1oz): 3.5g
- Cheese (1oz): 7g

There's more to write about this, but the gist is that I need to be making more of an effort to eat if I want to keep up. 

I brought an extra big lunch today. We'll see how it goes.
