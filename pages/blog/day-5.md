I'm past my quick gains now. My squat is now going up by 5lbs per workout (as opposed to 10). 

Deadlift still has some room to continue at 10lbs per workout. I had more juice in the tanks after today's session. 

I think the same is true of the press - but I'm going to leave it at 5lbs increase per workout. 

This has been a great way to blow off steam.
