On [Day 1](/blog/day-1/) I said I wasn't intimidated. Today a bunch of huge muscle people were in the gym (maybe it is a Thursday thing) and I felt out of place.

That's what I imagined them thinking. But I did the work none the less. On behalf of all skinny people working on getting strong, I completed the workout despite feeling out of place.
