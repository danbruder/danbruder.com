In order to get strong when you are a novice, you need to keep increasing weight until you can't any longer.  When you can't increase any more, you are no longer a novice, but an _intermediate_ athlete, according to Starting Strength. 

You are supposed to be able to increase weight linearly for the first many months, up to six I think. For the first few weeks, you increase each lift by 10lbs each workout, then by 5lbs. This should go on for some time. 

Rippetoe (the author) says if you aren't meeting these metrics, it is most likely due to an inadequate intake of food. The recommended intake is `1g` of protein per `lb` of weight. 

That means I need to be eating `150g` of protein per day (and more as my weight goes up), which I am finding takes more effort. You can't just eat what you feel like and expect to get it in, to get that much in you have to work at it.

## What does that look like?

Here's a breakdown of some common things I eat and their protein content:

- Eggs (1 egg): 6g
- Beef (1oz): 7g
- Chicken (1oz): 3.5g
- Cheese (1oz): 7g

A successful day could be:

- Breakfast (31g)
  - 4 eggs = 24g
  - 1oz cheese = 7g
- Lunch (35g)
  - 10oz of Chicken = 35g
- Dinner (70g)
  - 10oz of beef = 70g
  - 1oz cheese = 7g
- Snack
  - Something with 8g of protein ðŸ˜Š

That is actually the menu for me today. 

## Is it working?

If you are eating enough, you'll be able to recover in the allotted time period (48hrs). Thus, if you are still really sore by the next workout, you probably need to eat more. 

My second workout was actually 72hrs afterwards and I wasn't sore anymore - but was at the 48hr mark. That could be that this is all new for me, or that I didn't change my eating at all. 

I'm going to shoot for the`150g` mark here and see if I'm still sore on Saturday (my next workout). 

Today is the 24hr mark and I am _definitely_ sore.
