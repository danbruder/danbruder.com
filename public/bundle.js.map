Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

After reading and lilstening to the <a href=\\\"http://artofmanliness.com\\\">Art of Manliness</a>, I wound up buying <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-Basic-Barbell-Training/dp/0982522738\\\">Starting Strength</a>. The whole idea is to take a <strong>complete</strong> beginner and make them <em>strong</em> with an emphasis on long term health.</p>\\n<p>I recently came across another article that corroborated what I found on AoM - provocatively entitled <a href=\\\"http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504\\\">Everything You Know About Fitness Is a Lie</a>. The tldr; is that the author came accross <em>SS</em> by other means, followed it, and had great results. That is a horrible summary. You should probably read it yourself.</p>\\n<p>I had been holding off because it is uncomfortable and new to go to the gym and do things when you don’t <em>really</em> know what you are doing. The book helped with that - but I still lacked the experience. Well, yesterday, I dove in and I’m glad I did. It wasn’t anything like I was worried about!</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>More information here about my experience, and photos</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So here goes.
